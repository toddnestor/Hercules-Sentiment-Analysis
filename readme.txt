Hercules Sentiment Analysis adds columns to the comments and posts tables that show the sentiment of the comment, post title, and post content.

== Description ==

Hercules Sentiment Analysis uses PHP Insight (https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight) to determine whether comments, posts, and post titles
are positive, negative, or neutral.  This will help bloggers respond to readers who have concerns faster (or delete negative comments if necessary),
as well as know what sentiment they are portraying with their post titles and content.
